# Queer in tech website

The website is written in typescript with React. 

## Running the app
To run the app, open it up and run:
`npm i`
`npm run dev`

## Adding your content
### Changing your about us picture
Open up `./public/{yourname.jpg}` and replace that image.

### Adding gallery images
You can add your images to the folder `./public/gallery-images`.
To get them appearing on the gallery page you need to go to `Gallery.tsx`, and add your image names to the `imagePaths` array.

#### Compress your images!
Please compress the images so they load in quickly.

#### Rename your images
I've renamed mine to be gallery-image-{index} to make things easier. Feel free to do the same.
